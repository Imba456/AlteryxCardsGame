# AlteryxCardsGame
Practice your data transformations prior to building workflows.

This exercise was build out using Excalidraw.com (https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) for collaboration and ease of sketching.

Being able to visualise the transformations required in your head can be tough but being able to work through challenges step by step without trial and error helps to train your brain think through complex transformations.
Alteryx is one of our data transformation tools we use at The Data School to train people to become data consultants, hence we developed a few piece meal challenges and think through individual steps and the order of which things should be done before going into the software and building it out.

All the input files, expected output files, excalidraw scene and alteryx workflow can be downloaded directly from this repository.
The in and output files are .csv and .xls file types.
The excalidraw scene can be imported into Excalidraw (Excalidraw.com).
The packaged Alteryx workflow (.yxzp) can be extracted and run using Alteryx Designer (https://www.alteryx.com/designer-trial/free-trial-alteryx).
